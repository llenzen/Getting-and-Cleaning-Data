# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Created in fulfillment of the Coursera Johns Hopkins Course: "Getting and Cleaning Data".

# Introduction
The source data, "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", was provided by Jorge Reyes-Ortiz, et al.  This work takes the orignal data set and flattens the data, providing the means and standard deviations for each observation.   These values were than aggregated to show only the mean measurements for each subject and activity.  The column headers were standardized as defined in the code book, and the data was compiled to provide the subject and activity measured in each row.  The script for the transformation and analysis is "run_analysis.R".
