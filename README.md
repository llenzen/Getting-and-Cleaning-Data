# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Created in fulfillment of the Coursera Johns Hopkins Course: "Getting and Cleaning Data".

# Introduction
The source data, "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", was provided by Jorge Reyes-Ortiz, et al.  This work takes the orignal data set and flattens the data to provide the mean and standard deviation for each measurement per exercise.  The column headers were standardized as defined in the code book, and the data was compiled to provide the subject and exercise measured in each row.  The script for the transformation and analysis is "run_analysis.R".
